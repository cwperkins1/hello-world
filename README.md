Carson Perkins

I am a freshman at Radford University, I am majoring in Cyber Security, and I enjoy all things IT. I went to high school 10-15 mins away from RU at Auburn High School, where I graduated in 2020. I played basketball all 4 years of High School, winning a state championship my senior year.
